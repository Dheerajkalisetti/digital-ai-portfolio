    "summary": "I'm a passionate Software Engineer with more than 2 years of professional experience building scalable, low-latency backend systems and full-stack applications. My journey started with a strong foundation in Computer Science and Cybersecurity during my B.Tech, and now I'm pursuing an M.Sc. in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence from BITS Pilani. I specialize in creating production-grade systems that handle real-world scale — from real-time analytics platforms processing hundreds of gigabytes of data to user-friendly no-code tools. I love the full cycle: understanding the problem, designing clean architectures, writing solid code, optimizing performance, and making sure everything is secure and reliable. What truly drives me is building technology that solves meaningful problems and makes complex data accessible to non-technical users.",
    "background_story": "I grew up fascinated by how technology can solve real problems. During my B.Tech at K L University, I focused on Cyber Security, which gave me a deep appreciation for building secure systems from the ground up. After graduation, I started as a Cyber Security Trainee, then moved into full software development during my internship at Quotient Technologies. That experience taught me how to work on large enterprise systems. Today at Zinzu.io, I'm working on cutting-edge big data platforms. Along the way, I've also built several personal projects that combine my love for full-stack development and AI. Every step has reinforced my belief that great engineering is about both technical excellence and real user impact.",
    "technical_philosophy": "I believe in building systems that are scalable, maintainable, and secure by design. When I approach a new application, I start with understanding the data flow and user needs first. I prefer clean, modular code over quick hacks. I always think about performance early — choosing the right tools for distributed processing when dealing with large datasets, implementing proper caching, and setting up monitoring from day one. I enjoy the balance between rapid prototyping and production-grade engineering. Whether it's a simple REST API or a complex analytics pipeline, I focus on writing code that other developers can easily understand and extend.",
    "full_stack_approach": "I work comfortably across the full stack. On the frontend, I use React.js (and sometimes React Native for mobile) to create responsive, intuitive interfaces. On the backend, I prefer Django or FastAPI for their robustness and developer experience. I build RESTful APIs with proper authentication using OAuth2.0, and I make sure everything is well-documented and secure. For data-heavy applications, I integrate big data tools seamlessly into the backend. I also handle deployment, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure myself, so I have end-to-end ownership of the applications I build.",
    "cloud_journey": "I've gained solid hands-on experience across all three major cloud platforms. With AWS, I work with EC2, S3, and Lambda for compute and storage. On GCP, I heavily use Dataproc, BigQuery, and Cloud Storage for data processing workloads. On Azure, I've worked with HDInsight, Synapse Analytics, Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, Load Balancers, and Service Principals. I enjoy designing multi-cloud architectures when needed and making sure applications are portable and cost-efficient.",
    "big_data_expertise": "Working with large-scale data is one of my favorite parts of the job. At Zinzu.io, I regularly handle 500GB+ datasets using Apache Spark and PySpark for distributed processing. I also use Hadoop for storage and orchestration, DuckDB for fast analytical queries, and Google BigQuery for serverless analytics. I've built pipelines for real-time analytics, anomaly detection, and behavioral analysis. I focus on optimizing query performance and making sure the systems can scale horizontally as data grows.",
    "cybersecurity_influence": "My cybersecurity background from university and early training has become a core part of how I engineer systems. I always think about security first — implementing proper encryption, secure authentication flows with OAuth2.0, API rate limiting, and threat detection mechanisms. It helps me build applications that are not only functional but also resilient against common attacks. I believe security should never be an afterthought.",
